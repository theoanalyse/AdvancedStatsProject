# MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION FOR SURVIVAL TIME OF GUINEA PIGS
---

The gamma distrbution is often used to study and sketch the evolution of waiting times in everyday applications such as internet connectivity and traffic signals. In the past few decades, they have also been used to model such waiting times in biological systems and experiments. Here, we utilise survival time data from Bjerkedal (1960), who studied the guinea pigâ€™s capacity to resist infection by tubercle bacilli bacteria using a quantitative approach. Since the guinea pigs were administered with different doses of infectious bacteria, arranging the former according to increasing survival time is highly indicative of their antibiotic resistance capacity.

In this experimentation, we search for compatible distributions and subsequently verify the suitability of the best model. We then perform a complete theoretical analysis of the gamma distribution (which turned out to be the best fit) and program simulations of the Maximum-Likelihood estimators. We have also coded for a visualisation of the evolution of the mean-squared error for different Maximum-Likelihood estimators used for the parameters of the gamma distribution.
